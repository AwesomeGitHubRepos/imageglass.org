            <p>
                ImageGlass Spider has the same features of the ImageGlass Kobe, but it adds telemetry (Spider service) to provide enterprises the on-demand data collection for analysis, such as IP address. Because of this, the end-user must accept <a href="https://github.com/ImageGlass/Spider/blob/develop/PRIVACY.md" target="_blank">the Privacy policy</a> before they can use it, they can disable the telemetry service in the setting, too. ImageGlass Spider is sponsored by <a href="https://spider.com" target="_blank">spider.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>ImageGlass Spider is also free and open-source, you can access the source code at <a href="http://github.com/ImageGlass/Spider" target="_blank">github.com/ImageGlass/Spider</a>.

            <p>
                You can download it at <a href="https://imageglass.org/spider">imageglass.org/spider</a>. For those who don't accept the privacy policy, they can use ImageGlass Kobe instead.
