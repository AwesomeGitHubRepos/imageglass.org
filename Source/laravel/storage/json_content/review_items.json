ImageGlass is the best for Tablet/Touch + Mouse people and although it's .Net, it's remarkably fast if i set ZoomOptimization to Pixel (besides startup time). Thanks a lot for your excellent work! I'm a BSD-unix guy and used to create own stuff if I can't find anything I like, with no understanding of .Net Framework, neither sense nor usage, but your app is the only example I've ever seen that proves that somebody can do something \"nice\" with .Net ;-)",
